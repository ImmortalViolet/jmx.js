| 1 | bug | jmx.js:toggleAttrs() assumes that the div with jmxelement (ie the one with ref to model) is 3 levels up. This is true for the default templates, but need not be true for templates in the future. This logic needs to be made generic as noted in the journal of Nov 26 | Wont fix for v 1.0 | vinodkd |
| 2 | feature request | Autosave files as they're edited | Not started | |
| 3 | feature request | when loading the jmx file, if responsexml is null, try to read responseText and parse it as xml | Not started | |
